    title: "Climate Change",
    description: "Global warming and its effects on ecosystems and human societies.",
    longDescription: "Climate change involves global warming driven by human-induced emissions of greenhouse gases. This leads to large-scale shifts in weather patterns with widespread effects on human societies and ecosystems. Rising global temperatures lead to sea level rise, melting ice sheets, and extreme weather events. The Paris Agreement aims to limit warming to well below 2Â°C, but global cooperation and drastic emissions reductions are needed.",
